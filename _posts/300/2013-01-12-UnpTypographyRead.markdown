This is a very simple control which is designed to make it easy to read large blocks of static text, if you're publishing a manual, for example, this might be useful.

The Markup for the control is very simple, just use normal HTML inside the control like so:

<script src="https://gist.github.com/whitemx/7659359.js"></script>

When you use this control, two buttons will be placed in the header bar to allow the user to expand or shrink the text. If you are using the Database Search facility it will be hidden by these controls.
