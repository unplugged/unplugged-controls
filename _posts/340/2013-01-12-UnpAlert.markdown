# Function
The Alert control allows you to add a simple alert Dialog box to a page. It will display "over" the rest of the content of the page and will show 1 button: Continue.

If the user clicks the Continue button the dialog will be hidden.

The content of the dialog box is populated by adding the text or fields into the editable area on the XPage that you create. 

If the content of the dialog box is too tall for the page then make sure to use the unpScrollableArea control inside the editable area.

For an example of the Dialog in action download the samples database and open the XPage called UnpDemoDialog
